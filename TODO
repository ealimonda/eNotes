Things to do:

- Graphical tweaks all over the app
- Testing
- Ensure proper indentation (eclipse fails a lot)
- JavaDoc documentation
- Move all strings into strings.xml- Check screen rotation crashes- Ensure query safety with \ or ' (i.e. tag search)- Double-check email import- Add missing error messages, such as toasts (i.e. in case of attachment too big, invalid URL, failed import)
